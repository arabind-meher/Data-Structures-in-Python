    "A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.\n",
    "- Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.\n",
    "- LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the various types of linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.\n",
    "- Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.\n",
    "- Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the basic operations supported by a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "- Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "- Display − Displays the complete list.\n",
    "- Search − Searches an element using the given key.\n",
    "- Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.\n"
